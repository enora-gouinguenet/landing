				<p> As a Doctor for many years, I have always been eager to continue my training, which is why I am a practitioner of MBTI (personality), NLP, hypnotherapy, process com. Surrounded by high intellectual potential and dys, I had to use my coaching skills and a real vocation was born. I wish to coach all primary and secondary school pupils, students, parents, working people and entrepreneurs who need an external source of support to help them define their choices and approach. I believe that we can all find our place in society and thrive in that society.</p>
